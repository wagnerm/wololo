# wololo

It's a discord bot that makes WOLOLO sounds. It is ridiculous.

An message with `wololo` in it will make the bot join your voice channel and shout at you.

## Setup

## Bot setup

1. Create a bot for Discord (using discord developer website)
2. Create a `.env` file in the root of this repo with the following values
   ```
   DISCORD_TOKEN="my_bot_token"
   BOT_ID=123456789
   ```

### Audio files

There are no audio files included with this bot, you will have to get them yourself ðŸ˜œ

To make `wololo` work, grab the wololo wav file, and put it in the `audio/wololo` directory like so: `./audio/wololo/wololo.wav`
